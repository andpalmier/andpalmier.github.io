      <description>Last week I started hunting and reporting phishing websites on Twitter (follow me here if you are interested). After some digging, I have decided that it would be interesting to use this topic to refresh my memory around the basics of Machine Learning.
In this series of posts I am going to use a smaller variant of this dataset to create machine learning models which (hopefully) will be able to identify a phishing website.</description>
