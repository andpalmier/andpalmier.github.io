      <description>I started hunting and reporting phishing websites on Twitter: follow me here if you are interested! In this series of posts I am going to analyze and discuss some of the phishing kits found online.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start from the beginning I found this kit while analyzing the phishing sites reported by @illegalfawn. The zip was left exposed in the page, I believe the malicious actor forgot to remove it.</description>

      <description>I started hunting and reporting phishing pages on Twitter, follow me here if you are interested! After some digging, I have decided that it would be interesting to use this topic to refresh my memory around the basics of Machine Learning.
Introduction In the last post of this series, we analyzed how some of the parameters of a decision tree could improve the accuracy of the model when classifying phishing sites.</description>
