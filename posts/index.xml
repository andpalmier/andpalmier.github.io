      <description>I started hunting and reporting phishing websites on Twitter: follow me here if you are interested! In this series of posts I am going to analyze and discuss some of the phishing kits found online.

      <description>I started hunting and reporting phishing pages on Twitter, follow me here if you are interested! After some digging, I have decided that it would be interesting to use this topic to refresh my memory around the basics of Machine Learning.
Introduction In the last post of this series, we analyzed how some of the parameters of a decision tree could improve the accuracy of the model when classifying phishing sites.</description>

      <description>Last week I started hunting and reporting phishing websites on Twitter (follow me here if you are interested). After some digging, I have decided that it would be interesting to use this topic to refresh my memory around the basics of Machine Learning.
In this series of posts I am going to use a smaller variant of this dataset to create machine learning models which (hopefully) will be able to identify a phishing website.</description>

      <description>I am trying to acquire some knowledge on malware analysis by using &amp;lsquo;Practical Malware Analysis&amp;rsquo; (by Sikorski, Michael, and Andrew Honig, 2012). I will publish my solutions of the exercises as soon as I complete them; here you can find all the executables for the labs.
NOTE: I will try to use Linux utilities (such as pev, wrestool and Detect It Easy) instead of the Windows tools which are mentioned in the book.</description>
